// Question:

// There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with 
// one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting 
// each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all 
// the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

// The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by 
// a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 
// with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, 
// and so onâ€¦ Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

    if (costs === null || costs.length == 0) return 0 
    let len = costs.length
